# Agriculture-District-Wise
Personal Project for Data Science Operations on Agriculture Dataset.

## Overview

This project aims to analyze and predict agricultural trends in various districts across India using district-level data from the ICRISAT dataset. The focus is on rice and wheat production, with data spanning several decades. Through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), data visualization, and machine learning, we seek to uncover insights and forecast future agricultural outcomes. There are plans to expand this project to provide a GUI and other ease-of-life facilities for easy access.

## Broad Objectives

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Understand the structure and distribution of the dataset.
   - Identify trends, patterns, and anomalies in rice and wheat production.

2. **Data Visualization**:
   - Create visual representations of the data to highlight key insights.
   - Compare agricultural productivity across different districts and states.

3. **Machine Learning**:
   - Develop predictive models for rice and wheat yields.
   - Forecast future agricultural production based on historical data.

4. **Research Questions**:
   - How have the rice and wheat production trends changed over the years in different states and districts?
   - What are the growth rates of rice and wheat production in different regions?
   - Can we predict future rice and wheat yields based on historical data?
   - Which districts have the highest and lowest yields for rice and wheat?
   - How do different states compare in terms of rice and wheat production efficiency?
   - How does rice and wheat production vary between states like Chhattisgarh and others?
   - What policies or interventions have been most effective in increasing yields in specific states?
   - Are there any anomalies or outliers in the production or yield data that could indicate unusual events or errors?
   - What could be the possible reasons for these anomalies?
   - Can we develop a forecasting model to predict the future production of rice and wheat for different districts?
   - How accurate are these forecasts compared to actual production values?

## Dataset

The dataset includes district-level information on the area, production, and yield of rice and wheat across various states in India. Key columns in the dataset are:
- `Dist Code`: District Code
- `Year`: Year of data collection
- `State Code`: State Code
- `State Name`: Name of the state
- `Dist Name`: Name of the district
- `RICE AREA (1000 ha)`: Area of rice cultivation in thousand hectares
- `RICE PRODUCTION (1000 tons)`: Rice production in thousand tons
- `RICE YIELD (Kg per ha)`: Rice yield in kilograms per hectare
- `WHEAT AREA (1000 ha)`: Area of wheat cultivation in thousand hectares
- `WHEAT PRODUCTION (1000 tons)`: Wheat production in thousand tons
- `WHEAT YIELD (Kg per ha)`: Wheat yield in kilograms per hectare

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Handle missing values and inconsistencies in the dataset.
   - Ensure data types and formats are appropriate for analysis.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Conduct descriptive statistics and visualizations.
   - Identify trends, correlations, and anomalies in the data.

3. **Data Visualization**:
   - Create visualizations to represent the spatial and temporal trends in agricultural production.
   - Use libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly for effective visualizations.

4. **Machine Learning**:
   - Develop models to predict future yields and production.
   - Use regression techniques and time series analysis for forecasting.
   - Evaluate model performance and refine as necessary.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Python**: Primary programming language for data analysis and machine learning.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn/Plotly**: For data visualization.
- **Scikit-Learn**: For machine learning model development.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive analysis and documentation.
